My personal website made with [Remix](https://remix.run) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). Hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com).

## Development

You will be running two processes during development:

- The Miniflare server (a local environment for Cloudflare Workers)
- The Remix development server

### Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aelew/com.git
```

Go to the project directory

```sh
cd com
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm i
```

Start the local development server on

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open up [http://127.0.0.1:8787](http://127.0.0.1:8787) and you should be ready to go!
